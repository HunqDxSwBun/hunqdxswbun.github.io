Moon looking bright tonight
High in the sky
Like trying to keep you alive
Alright
Just stay away from me
Let me down easily
You’re too late
You’re too late
Don’t you pray
Don’t you pray
Seeking for my embrace
Wanting my touch, begging me to stay
Every night and day
Calling my name, shout it till you break
You took my heart
Held it and ripped it apart
Made me your prisoner
Got me going right under
Feeling that you feign
Fooling me again
No need to explain
Taking my own lane
God’s helping me out
Get over my doubt
Thought I can’t live without
Forget you right now
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Making my way
Making my way
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Making my way
Making my way

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Making my way
Making my way
Ah ah ah ah
Making my way
Making my way
Ah ah ah ah
Making my way
Making my way
I wanna know the cure
For all that time you make me endure
All the words you say
Ought to keep your prey well and behaved
I reckon’ it’s time
Betting my luck on dimes
Taking new leap in
Getting far away from your cheating
Telling me “I’ll kill for you”
Like a truth
With no proof
Never knew
Was a doll, now the thing you pulled, never make me yield
Pin you down like a golden view
Right uphill
Make you dwell
What I feel
Wish you well
Living right in the kingdom I built anew
Draining tears and wallow in guilt
